## 🔥 THE TECH STACK

<div align="center">

| Technology | Purpose |
|:----------:|:-------:|
| **On-Chain Program** | Verifiable fee collection infrastructure |
| **Helius Sender** | Ultra-low latency transaction submission with SWQOS |
| **Helius RPC** | High-performance Solana infrastructure |
| **Solana Web3.js** | Native blockchain integration |

</div>

### On-Chain Infrastructure

Token Spawner operates with a deployed Solana program for transparent, verifiable fee collection:

```
Program ID: FeeCoXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Network: Mainnet
```

All fee collection is executed on-chain through the program, ensuring transparency and verifiability.

### The Difference

```
Traditional Airdrops: Send → Wait → Send → Wait → Send...
Token Spawner:       Send 1,000 transactions simultaneously
```

Parallel processing at scale.
